# Celestial Brothers Code of Conduct
The Celestial Brothers Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Celestial Brothers' values into practice. It is built around the idea that we shall be a community of great people, host great events, and be well-regarded by those around us. Please do read the Code and follow both in spirit and letter. If you ever have a question, or believe that any Member (or Celestial Brothers as a whole) may be falling short of our commitment, please let us hear from you.

## Who Must Follow Our Code?
We expect all Members of Celestial Brothers to know and follow the Code. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. In addition, while the Code is written specifically for Members of Celestial Brothers, it is expected that all guests and event attendees follow the Code during their time with us.

## What If I Have a Question or Concern?
Please let us hear from you! You are encouraged to escalate your concerns directly to the High Council. If the nature of the concern prevents doing so, you may have it anonymously brought to the attention of the High Council by notifying a member of the Staff.

# Article I - Activity
As a community, we strive to continually be active and engaging for people both inside and out of the game. Despite that, we recognize that **life comes first**. Our activity policy aims to ensure that you're not unjustly punished for not having time to play a game, while still trying to provide an accurate picture of our activity at face value.  

If you are a Member^ of Celestial Brothers who has fallen inactive for more than sixty (60) days your in-game rank will changed to "Recruit." Upon your return and sustained activity, your rank shall change to reflect your previous position. Repeted inactivity shall have no additional punishment for Members.  

For the purpose of this policy, activity shall be determined by the most recent date of experience gain in-game. Those who fall inactive in-game but remain active in the community outside of the game may still be considered active.  

Sustained inactivity (currently defined as inactivity for a period greater than one (1) year) may result in removal from the clan in-game under the assumption of quitting the game. This does not necessarily reflect a removal of membership from the community.  

*^See Staff Expectations below for how the activity policy affects members of the Staff.*

# Article II - Respect
Be respectful of your fellow Clan members and other players in general. Acknowledge differences with reason and an open mind; it is mandatory to show tolerance and consideration to one another, to our allies, and to our guests. While there are bound to be disagreements, the presence of respect prevents their escalation into an argument.   

We absolutely do NOT tolerate blatantly aggressive, discriminatory, or provocative behavior.

# Article III - No Drama Policy
At the end of the day, we're all just here to have fun in a game. While we recognize that life (and even games) aren't perfect, we endeavor to maintain a positive, low-stress environment for each other and our guests. For this reason, we ask that you avoid bringing up controversial topics in large group settings, including religion and politics.  

We also understand that not everybody can always get along. While disagreements are bound to happen, do not let them spill out into public settings. The Staff are more than happy to address your concerns privately, as doing so allows a more focused discussion and a more efficient resolution.

# Article IV - Out-Of-Game Communications
Celestial Brothers uses various out-of-game resources which may provide ways for Members to communicate either publicly or among each other. Member conduct on these resources is still beholden to the Code where applicable, and may fall subject to additional policy.

## Section 1 - Conduct in Voice Chats
When using voice chats, please continue to be mindful of those around. Whenever possible, use push-to-talk as your method of transmitting voice. Disruptive behaviors (such as excessive background noise, mumbling self-narratives, overuse of soundboards, and "second-hand audio") may result in disciplinary action or people avoiding you.

# Article V - Staff Expectations
As a leader of the community, you are held to a higher standard. This includes both behavior and activity. Your position as a member of the Staff signifies an additional committment to the clan and its mission.

## Section 1 - Activity
Staff who have been inactive for thirty (30) days shall lose their status as "in good standing" with regards to their position as a Staff member.   

For the purpose of this policy, activity shall be determined by the most recent date of experience gain in-game.

## Section 2 - Moderation
All moderation actions taken by Staff members must be done in a fair and impartial manner. Punitive actions against others should always be reported in a general staff channel, including the action, target, and reason, to ensure partiality and transparency.
