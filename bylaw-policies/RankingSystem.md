# Clan Ranking System
As set forth in the Bylaws, the Clan shall establish a system through which Members may earn rank by applying point values to various activities.

# How it Works
Members may gain points by completing activities that are deemed to contribute value for the clan. In-game ranks shall be gained and lost by crossing various point thresholds. Some activities may be tracked automatically, whereas others must be logged by the Staff.

# Points
Points are used as a measure of cumulative activity, loyalty, and contribution to the clan. Points may only be gained; deductions shall not occur unless correcting a mistake in reporting. Only pre-approved activities may be eligible for points as defined in this document. 

# Eligible Activities  

## Recruiting  
* **Points:** 200
* **Description:** Recruiting a new member into the clan. The new member must remain in the clan for (at the Staff's discretion) a reasonable amount of time, else the points may be deemed invalid. 
* **Tracking Method:** A member of the Staff must see the recruitment notification in Clan Chat or the recruiting member must claim the recruit to be awarded points.
## Capping at the Clan Citadel
* **Points:** 100
* **Description:** Contributing the personal maximum amount of resources at the Clan Citadel in a given week. An additional amount of bonus points may be applied during Capping Events with the value determined in the event announcement.
* **Tracking Method:** Caps are tracked automatically. Members must have their Adventure Log publicly viewable to be tracked. Capping Event bonus points are tracked as a normal event.
## Event Participation (Official Events)
* **Points:** 100
* **Description:** Participating in events that have been scheduled and hosted by the Staff. Qualification may depend on time spent at the event.
* **Tracking Method:** Event host shall count participants based on the event's criteria and award points upon event conclusion.
## Event Participation (Unofficial Events)
* **Points:** 75
* **Description:** Participating in events that have been scheduled and hosted by other members, or spontaneous events hosted by the Staff. Qualification may depend on time spent at the event.
* **Tracking Method:** Event host shall count participants based on the event's criteria and award points upon event conclusion. If the event host is not a member of the Staff, participant list shall be given to a member of the Staff to ensure points are awarded.
## Event Hosting (All)
* **Points:** `[event points] + (([event points]/10) * participants)`
* **Description:** Points for hosting an event. Amount of points awarded is determined by the above formula. Points awarded to the host should be equal to the participation amount (regardless of participation by the host) with an additional bonus of one-tenth that amount per participant.
* **Tracking Method:** Staff shall calculate and apply the host points upon event conclusion.

# Ranks
The in-game clan ranks are primarily split into two tiers--members and staff--with General being the highest member rank and Administrator being the lowest staff rank. Movement between tiers have additional requirements on top of the point value.

## Gaining Rank
Upon fulfiling the requirements for their next rank, members will be marked eligible for promotion during the next rank check.  

Rank checks shall occur weekly on Saturdays, during which all members eligible for promotion shall be moved exactly one rank up the hierarchy. Should a member be eligible for a rank higher than the next immediate rank relative to their current rank, their eligibility shall carry over to the following rank check.
